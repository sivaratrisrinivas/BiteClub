## Critical Dependencies

**Sequential (must be done in order):**
1. Task 1 â†’ Task 4 â†’ Task 5 â†’ Task 6 â†’ Task 7
2. Task 2 â†’ Task 3 â†’ Task 8 â†’ Task 9
3. Task 8 â†’ Task 10 â†’ Task 12
4. All core tasks â†’ Task 15 â†’ Task 16 â†’ Task 17 â†’ Task 18 â†’ Task 19

**Parallel opportunities:**
- Task 3 can be done parallel with Task 4-5
- Task 8 can be done parallel with Task 6-7
- Task 11 can be done parallel with Task 10
- Task 13 can be done parallel with Task 12

## Definition of Done for Each Task

**Every task must have:**
- [ ] Code written and tested
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Handles basic error cases
- [ ] Git commit with clear message

**No task is "done" until it works end-to-end.**

## Time Estimates (Reality Check)

- Foundation tasks: 2-3 days
- Core features: 5-7 days  
- Viral mechanics: 4-5 days
- Polish & shipping: 3-5 days

**Total: 14-20 days of actual work**

Add 50% buffer for unexpected bullshit = 21-30 calendar days.

## The Truth About Project Management

- These estimates are optimistic
- You'll discover 5 tasks you didn't know existed
- iOS and Android will behave differently in ways you don't expect
- Third-party APIs will fail when you least expect it
- Plan for 4 weeks, celebrate if you ship in 3

**Most important rule:** Don't move to the next task until the current one actually works. "90% done" tasks will kill your project.
