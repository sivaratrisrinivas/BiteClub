**Make healthy eating fun by competing with your friends**

## What is BiteClub?

BiteClub is a mobile app that turns eating healthy into a fun competition with your friends. Here's how it works:

1. **üì∏ Take a photo** of your meal
2. **ü§ñ Get an instant health score** (1-10) powered by AI 
3. **üèÜ Compete with friends** on daily leaderboards
4. **‚ö° Challenge losing friends** to eat healthier

Think of it like a fitness tracker, but for food - and way more social and fun.
